# SpinalCordImaging

The source code for the method described in the manuscript "Evaluation of distortion correction methods in diffusion MRI of the spinal cord" [https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03817],  which was submitted to PLOS ONE on August 12th, 2021, and is still under review. In this work, I proposed novel geometric metrics to evaluate different distortion correction methods by measuring the alignment of the reconstructed diffusion model with the spine.


Research conducted my PhD research at Empenn (ex. VisAGeS) research Unit, Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique, University of Rennes 1 (France) under the supervision of Christian Barillot and Emmanuel Caruyer.

This source code is open for anyone to use and reproduce. Some parts are not optimized or structured for general use, as they were intended for specific projects. Hope you find this helpful!
