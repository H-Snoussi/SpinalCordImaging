# SpinalCordImaging

Source code from my PhD Research: "Population imaging and diffusion MRI for characterizing multiple sclerosis in the human spinal cord".

Research conducted at Empenn (ex. VisAGeS) research Unit, Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique, University Rennes 1 (France) under the supervision of Christian Barillot and Emmanuel Caruyer. Throughout the PhD work I had to write pieces of code to carry out various tasks: 1- distortion correction of diffusion MRI for spinal cord study, 2- characterization of multiple sclerosis abnormalities within the cervical spinal cord, and 3- reproducibility and evolution of diffusion MRI measurements.

This source code is open for anyone to use and to reproduce. Some codes are not optimised or structured for general use, as they were intended for specific projects. Hope you find this useful!
